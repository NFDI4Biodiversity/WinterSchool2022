# WinterSchool2022

NFDI4Biodiversity and GfÖ organized a joined Winter School in December 2022. In this one-week course, the participants were introduced to research data management across the data life cycle. 

The Winter School was developed for Early-Career-Researcher (ECRs) with a background in biodiversity and environmental science. The workshop in 2022 was a collaborative event between the [Ecological Society of Germany, Austria and Switzerland (GfÖ)](https://gfoe.org/) and the consortium [NFDI4Biodiversity](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org) within the [National Research Data Infrastructure Germany (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/). Various experts from the partner network (universities, data centers and research institutions) shared their widespread knowledge and trained participants in the fundamentals of Research Data Management (RDM) as well as cutting-edge technologies in handling environmental and biodiversity data across the Data Life Cycle (DLC).

Learning objectives of the course:

*    How to create a data management plan
*    How to use Jupyter in combination with R, Python as working environment
*    How to standardize data
*    Legal aspects in handling data
*    How to handle spatial data
*    How to extract data from open-access databases
*    How to assure data quality
*    How to integrate & harmonize data
*    How to publish data

## Tutorials

In practical lessons, participants were introduced to Jupyter Notebook as a powerful RDM and development environment for notebooks, code and data. Here, we link two of the Jupyter Notebooks that were used in the course:
